# Computer Requirements

## For Web Development, JavaScript, React and Data Analytics
We recommend you use either:

- An Apple laptop newer than 6 years old running one of the 3 most recent major releases of MacOS (currently: 10.14 (Mojave) or newer)
- A PC laptop newer than 4 years old running Windows 10

Machines outside these parameters may still work, but might have issues running the software and tooling needed to complete coursework. Juno will only be able to provide limited support to older computers, OS versions, and other operating systems not listed above (e.g. Linux). 

At this time laptops running ChromeOS (“Chromebooks”) don’t easily run the software and tools we need for coursework at Juno and cannot be used with our courses.

## For UX
Juno students will need a Mac for this class. We recommend you use:

- An Apple laptop newer than 6 years old running one of the 3 most recent major releases of MacOS (currently: 10.14 (Mojave) or newer)

Machines outside these parameters may still work, but might have issues running the software and tooling needed to complete coursework.
