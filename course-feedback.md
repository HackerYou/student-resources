# Submitting Course Feedback
Throughout your time at Juno College, you will be given opportunities to provide feedback for the program. Survey links will be shared with you by your instructor in Slack. Your feedback, insight, positive experiences and criticisms are all hugely important to us to hear fully and honestly, so please share us whatever you feel comfortable telling us in the feedback forms! The forms are anonymous unless you choose to leave your name.

If you have feedback you'd like to share outside of these forms, don't hesitate to reach out to our Senior Program Operations Manager [Joanna Ebejer](mailto:joanna@junocollege.com) via email or slack.
