# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** I have an older computer than the requirements of my course. Will I need to use a totally different laptop/computer for the courses? </br>
**A:** If the computer is a bit older than the requirements of our courses, try that computer out! If during the first few classes you notice your computer is not working well, you might have to find an alternative for your course.

**Q:** If I've taken a Juno course, do I get a discount on other Juno courses? </br>
**A:** Yes! Juno Alumni get a discount - there's an alumni discount of $250, so all alumni will get this applied for future courses. Unfortunately, this does not include family members.

**Q:** If I take a course at Juno College, will I be given a certificate or letter of completion? </br>
**A:** If you have taken one of our Part-Time or Accelerated courses, a letter of completion is given to students by request only. If you'd like to receive this, please contact Laura Easson via [Slack](https://junocollege.slack.com/team/U01JN7E8ELE) or [email](mailto:laura.easson@junocollege.com). For our Bootcamp programs, you will receive a printed copy of your certificate via mail. Laura will let your cohort know when you'll approximately receive this. Sadly, we cannot provide a digital copy of your certificate, but if you need a letter of completion before you receive your printed certificate in the mail, you can contact Laura Easson via [Slack](https://junocollege.slack.com/team/U01JN7E8ELE) or [email](mailto:laura.easson@junocollege.com).

**Q:** I have enrolled in a course but have not received any information regarding the course. Who should I contact? </br>

**Q:** Do I get a tax form for my course? </br>
**A:** If you would like more information on receiving tax forms, please visit our [Infomation on Tax Forms](./tax-information.md) page. 

**Q:** How necessary is it to have access to a webcam for Juno courses? </br>
