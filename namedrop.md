3. Click the “Record” button and say your name - it may ask you to allow your microphone access, click “allow” in this case
4. You can play it back to see if you like it!
5. Click the “Submit” button - once this is clicked, it will take you to your Dashboard, where on the top left corner, 
your link for the recording of your name will be displayed (i.e. https://namedrop.io/lauraeasson). Please put this link in the Pre-Course Form found in
