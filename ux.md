## Computer Requirements
Juno students will need a Mac for this class. We recommend you use:
- An Apple laptop newer than 6 years old running one of the 3 most recent major releases of MacOS (currently: 10.14 (Mojave) or newer)
- A PC laptop newer than 4 years old running Windows 10
 
Machines outside these parameters may still work, but might have issues running the software and tooling needed to complete coursework. 


## Where to Ask for Help
There are many ways to ask for help after class hours: 
1. You can use the Slack Channel **#helpme** and you'll be able to ask your question to many alumni of our programs
2. Use the **classroom channel** for your course to ask a question and perhaps a classmate or two will be able to help you!
